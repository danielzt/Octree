# Octree
Simple octree implementation for Unity written in C#

# Progress
This was meant to be a POC implementation of using adapted meta-ball objects to be able to create detailed realistic objects. The code in the repository does fulfill this purpose to a major extent as it can render the iso-surface generated by an implicit function. Due to memory management problems in Unity it is not feasible to continue the project in the direction that I want to take it.

# Problems
The overheads associated with most objects in the .Net framework are far too great to be able to efficiently construct high density meshes from implicit functions. I have literally pull out as many tricks as I could to improve the efficiency of the process but the memory consumption is still obscene. I have now moved to using C++ with Unreal Engine and currently the performance is being hindered by inefficiencies in the algorithm and memoery consumptions appear to the much more reasonable.
